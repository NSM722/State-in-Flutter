## Riverpod

Riverpod is a simple way to access your state and manage your state in Flutter.

It is a Provider replacement that is more powerful and easier to use.

### ConsumerWidget

This is a stateless widget that listens to changes to a provider and rebuilds when the provider changes.

This means the UI will update when the provider changes.

`ref.watch()` - Listens to changes in a provider and rebuilds the widget when the provider changes.
